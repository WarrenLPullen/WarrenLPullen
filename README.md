- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WarrenLPullen

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, backend development, and data storytelling â€” using data to uncover insights, generate reports, and support decision-making.
  I also enjoy implementing new IT services and have a growing interest in IT project management, especially where technical and business needs intersect.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQL, and Java, while studying Computing & IT and Business at the Open University.
  Iâ€™m also participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge to build real-world coding experience.
